## Stages:
* Planning
    * why do this at all, reasons, clients
* Analysis
    * project requirements 
* Design
    * planning out structure of software
* Implementation
    * writing code and testing
* Maintenance
    * intermittent checks to keep system functioning properly

## Metodologies
* Waterfall
    * the traditional plan everything out and go in sequential stages
* Spiral
    * iterative model that loops through main 4 stages and spends more time on a stage depending on risk assesment
* Agile
    * to overcome the shortcomings of waterfall
    * high client interaction
    * high volume of communication between team members
    * follows interative model so that it is easy/less costly to reponds to change

## eXtreme Programming
* everything done in pairs
* birthed code reviews
    * sit down nwith another developer and explain your code to get advice & feedback

## Scrum
* user stories define project requirements which become product backlog
    * As a \__ , I want to \__ , so that \__
* project broken down into multiple "sprints" which are short 1-4 week iterations to focus and develop specific chosen user stories
* Product Owner and Scrum Master are only 2 fixed roles
* Daily standup meetings to check everyone's prograss and see what everyone finished since yesterday, going to do today, and specify and difficulties
* Working agreement to specify common agreements on how the team should run
* Definition of Done
    * what constitutes the user stroy as done

## Test Driven development
* first build tests cases that should pass for a "working" feature
* make minimum change in code to correct errors and satisfy the test case
* does not adapt to change easily

## Feature Driven
* build main framework first and then interatively build features to add onto the model
* not ideal for small projects
* significant toll for team leads, reliance on single person
